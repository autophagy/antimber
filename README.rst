antimber
  noun: matter, materials, substance

These are a set of nix expressions and dotfiles for my Linux workspace. Depends
on `home-manager`_.

Currently using `NixOS`_, with `i3`_ as my window manager and
`Neovim`_ as my primary development environment.

The top level directory contains my NixOS configuration, and `home-manager` contains
my home-manager configuration.

*My legacy Arch Linux dotfiles are available on the* `arch`_ *branch.*
